## Installation with Docker

### Environment Variables

```bash
HOST=192.168.x.x      # IP address of the host machine
PORT=3000             # Port for the web interface
MEMORYNODE=2048       # Memory allocation in MB
USE_SSL=0             # Set to 1 to enable SSL
```

**Important Notes:**
- Use the actual IP address of your machine rather than localhost for testing
- Adjust `MEMORYNODE` for maximum memory size under the limit of container memory (10% less than container limit is recommended)

### Configuration

Before starting the container, set the correct IP address and local port.

If you change the IP from localhost to another address and the container starts with the wrong IP, you can manually change the IP in [`UIconfig.js`](web/vue/dist/UIconfig.js) or delete the container and rebuild.

## TODO

- Clean dependencies and some strategies that don't work
